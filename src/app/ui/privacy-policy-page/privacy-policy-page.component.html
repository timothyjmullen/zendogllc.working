                    <h2>Security</h2>
                    <p>
                    We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
                  </p>
                    <p>
                    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
                  </p>
